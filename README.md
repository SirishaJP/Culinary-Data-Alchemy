# Data-Driven Insights for Seasonal Menu Alchemy: Profits, Segmentation, Trends, and Testing

The culinary domain, especially in the context of seasonal menu curation, is increasingly defined by data-driven precision and innovation. In this comprehensive project, we embark on an in-depth exploration of a hypothetical restaurant enterprise, where the primary objective is to achieve the pinnacle of menu optimization. Our journey spans a rich landscape of sophisticated data analyses, including profitability assessments, customer segmentation, time series investigations, and robust A/B testing. Through advanced data science methodologies, we aim to extract profound insights and refine the art of Seasonal Menu Alchemy.

## Analysis 1: Profitability Analysis

**Objective**: To identify high-profit menu items via rigorous cost analysis and optimized pricing strategies.

**Methodology**: Our exploration begins with a meticulous examination of cost prices and selling prices, where we calculate profits using the formula:

             Profit = (Selling Price - Cost Price) * Quantity Sold


**Results**: Through this analytical prism, the **Avocado Chicken Bowl** emerges as a standout, commanding a selling price of € 12.50, yielding a substantial total profit of € 1,125.00. It's an exemplary case of menu engineering that significantly contributes to the restaurant's bottom line.

## Analysis 2: Customer Segmentation

**Objective**: To categorize patrons into distinct segments, defined by demographic and spending characteristics, enabling tailored marketing strategies.

**Methodology**: Employing K-Means clustering, we employ a feature selection process, focusing on age and expenditure as essential attributes. Subsequently, we employ data scaling to ensure a balanced approach.

**Results**: The outcomes of our segmentation reveal three primary customer segments, each offering a unique lens into patronage. We distinguish:

- **Segment 0 (Low Spend Customers)**: With an average age of 30, they contribute an average of € 22 to the restaurant's revenue.
- **Segment 1 (Medium Spend Customers)**: An older demographic with an average age of 40, this group provides an average spending of € 30.
- **Segment 2 (High Spend Customers)**: With an average age of 48, this demographic yields a substantial average spending of € 40.

## Analysis 3: Time Series Trends

**Objective**: To decode temporal trends in sales and customer count, furnishing insights for optimized resource allocation.

**Methodology**: Our time series analysis leverages advanced data visualization techniques, unveiling intricate seasonal patterns. Mathematical modeling and statistical analysis play a central role in pattern recognition and forecasting.

**Results**: Our findings uncover the cyclicality of sales and customer counts, culminating in peak performances during the winter months. These temporal insights offer a roadmap for resource allocation optimization.

## Analysis 4: A/B Testing (T-Test)

**Objective**: To empirically validate the impact of menu changes on sales, underpinned by statistical rigor.

**Methodology**: In the tradition of hypothesis testing, we frame a null hypothesis (H0) positing no significant difference in sales between the old menu (Group A) and the new warm menu (Group B). A t-test is employed to rigorously analyze the total revenue of these groups.

**Results**: Our t-test yields a t-statistic of -2.4305594055372253 and a p-value of 0.031700105639650575. In the realm of statistics, these results unequivocally lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis (H0). The new warm menu (Group B) unmistakably outperforms the old menu (Group A) in terms of sales.
